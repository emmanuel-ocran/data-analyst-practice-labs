# Data Analyst Practice Labs

Welcome to my personal learning repository. This space contains hands-on practice labs as I develop my skills in:

- 🐍 **Python** for data cleaning, transformation, and automation  
- 🛢️ **SQL** for querying and analyzing structured data  
- 📊 **Excel** for modeling, formulas, and reporting  
- 📈 **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and storytelling

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- SQL (PostgreSQL-style syntax)
- Excel (pivot tables, formulas, KPI tracking)
- Power BI (DAX, visuals, filters)
- Git & GitHub for version control and documentation

---

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `/excel/`: KPI trackers and dashboards
- `/powerbi/`: Power BI report files and
