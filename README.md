# Data Analyst Practice Labs

Welcome to my personal learning repository!
This space contains hands-on labs and practice projects as I develop and apply my skills in:

- 🐍 Python for data cleaning, transformation, and automation  
- 🧮 SQL for querying and analyzing relational data  
- 📊 Excel for calculations, KPI tracking, and reports  
- 📈 Power BI for interactive dashboards and data storytelling  

I created this repo to reinforce my learning, track progress, and share my growth publicly as I train to become a professional **Data Analyst** with cloud fluency.
