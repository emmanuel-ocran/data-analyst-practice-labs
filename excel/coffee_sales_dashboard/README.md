## 📌 Project Objective

To transform raw sales data into a clean, interactive dashboard that answers business questions such as:

- Which roast type and product size drive the most revenue?
- How do sales vary by time, region, and customer?
- Who are the top-performing customers and countries?
- How can we use filters to segment data by loyalty card usage, date, and more?

- Dashboard design and formatting best practices

## 📊 Outcome
